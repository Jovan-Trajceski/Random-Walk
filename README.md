# Random Walk - Monte Carlo Simulation
Introduction
> Classic random walk problem was solved by using Monte Carlo simulation.\
Visualizations of random walk processes and results are provided below.\
Probability rate of winning is also provided.\
The program is written in Python via Jupiter Notebook.\
The code runs 10,000 simulations.
